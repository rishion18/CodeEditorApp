How to use my code editor - 
1. opening the link you can see three editors , one for HTML and others for CSS and javaScript.
2. all editors have two buttons - copy and lock
3. when we press copy , it copies code in respective editor to clipboard and the button text changes to copied
4. When we press lock button it makes the editor un-editable and we can toggle between locked and unclocked
5. the output is rendered below Output mark.
